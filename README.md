# TerraGenbyKushagraKhatri
An AI-powered platform that generates sustainable crop recommendations using soil and weather data.
🌍 TerraGen — by Kushagra Khatri
Revolutionizing agriculture through AI, data, and design.

🌱 Overview
TerraGen is an AI-powered web application that helps farmers and agricultural researchers determine the most suitable crops for different soil types and locations.
Using Generative AI and environmental data, TerraGen aims to empower farmers with data-driven insights to improve yield, reduce uncertainty, and promote sustainable agriculture.

Built entirely with Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project represents the next generation of AI-driven tools for global food security and climate-smart farming.

💡 Core Idea
Agricultural productivity depends heavily on soil, climate, and crop selection. Yet, millions of farmers still rely on guesswork or outdated information.
TerraGen eliminates this gap by generating intelligent crop recommendations using generative AI, considering:

Soil composition and type

Geographic region

Real-world agricultural trends

🚀 Features
🧠 AI-Generated Crop Recommendations — Dynamic analysis based on soil and location

🌎 Country & Soil Type Dropdowns — Full global dataset with customizable input

💬 User-Friendly Interface — Clean, minimal design with interactive elements

⚡ Real-Time Results — Quick and smart crop suggestions powered by Flask

🧩 Scalable Architecture — Ready for integration with APIs like NASA POWER, FAO, and OpenMeteo

🧠 How It Works
Users select their soil type and country from dropdown menus.

TerraGen’s backend sends this data to a Generative AI model.

The model evaluates environmental patterns and returns recommended crops best suited to those conditions.
